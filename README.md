Note that custom sounds may be set in separate procedures for notifications, versus for alarms, versus for phone calls.
Within each of these areas separate custom sounds may be set for each kind of notification, for each alarm, for each contact, as well as default sounds in some cases.

Here's some Android hints:

===========================================

In all cases:

Step 1: Copy all the MP3 files to your phones \alarms AND \notifications AND \ringtone folders.
This requires connecting your phone to a PC for data access, select internal memory, and browse to the folder.

Step 2: Reboot your phone.
This makes sure it re-scans the ringtones folder.

Step 3: On Android for defaults: Settings > Sounds > Ringtone | Settings > Sounds > Notifications Sounds
Step 4: Settings > Notifications > individually open each app's options and set custom sounds.
